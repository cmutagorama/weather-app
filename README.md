# Weather app

This app is fully functional, you don't need to integrate anything. Just **Plug and play**! Before that create 2 free accounts, one on [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/register) another on [mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/).

After creating both accounts, you will have your own secret key and an access token, go and paste them in `/src/utils/forecast.js` and `/src/utils/geocode.js` respectively. Note that Dark Sky API is giving us forecast data while mapbox API is for geocoding.
